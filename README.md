# AI-Powered Fitness Repetition Counter
Designed and implemented a fitness monitoring system leveraging Scikit-learn, OpenCV, and Mediapipe to track and analyze exercise repetitions with high accuracy for bicep curls, squats, and deadlifts.

- Real-Time Pose Estimation: Utilized Mediapipe for efficient skeletal movement detection in live video streams.
- Repetition Counting Models: Trained models using Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers to accurately count exercise repetitions based on pose data.
- Personalized Feedback: Provided real-time feedback, including precise repetition counts and optional guidance on exercise form using predefined criteria.
- User-Friendly Interface: Developed a Flask-based web application with an intuitive interface, enabling seamless interaction and visualization of exercise metrics.
