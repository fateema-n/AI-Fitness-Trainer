# AI-Powered Fitness Repetition Counter
This project introduces a fitness monitoring system that utilizes machine learning and computer vision to accurately count repetitions of specific exercises.

Key Features:

- Real-time Pose Estimation: Employs Mediapipe for precise and efficient pose detection in live video streams, capturing the user's skeletal movements. Â  
- Repetition Counting: Leverages scikit-learn to build and utilize pre-trained models to accurately count the number of repetitions performed for specific exercises, such as bicep curls, squats, and deadlifts.
- Personalized Feedback: Provides users with real-time feedback on their exercise performance, including:
- Repetition Count: Accurately tracks and displays the number of repetitions completed.
- Form Guidance: Optionally provides feedback on exercise form based on pre-defined criteria.
- User-Friendly Interface: A Flask-based web interface ensures a seamless user experience with intuitive interaction and clear visualization of exercise data.
